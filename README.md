# 🔧 Advanced ZWebhookSuite  
*A Discord Cog by **TheHolyOneZ***  

### Overview
**Advanced ZWebhookSuite** is an all-in-one **webhook editing & management dashboard** for Discord servers.  
It gives server owners and moderators an easy, button-driven control panel to **fix, edit, back-up, and monitor** messages that were posted through Discord webhooks—without touching any code.

---

## ✨ What You Can Use It For
- **Fix broken messages** (HTML entities, formatting issues, typos) in bulk or one-by-one.  
- **Mass-edit entire channels** of webhook posts in a single operation.  
- **Securely store and manage** multiple webhooks with encrypted tokens.  
- **Monitor system health & progress** in real time while edits run.  
- **Create backups and recover** webhook messages at any time.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Non-Technical)
1. **Install the Cog** in your Discord bot as you would any other Cog.  
2. In Discord, type either:
   * Slash command: `/zwebhooksuite`  
   * Prefix command: `!zwebhooksuite` (or aliases `!zws`, `!webhook-suite`)  
3. The bot opens a **private control panel** with interactive buttons.  
4. Click a button to launch a tool, fill in the simple forms, and follow on-screen help.

No programming needed—everything happens inside Discord.

## 🎛️ Main Control Panel Buttons
| Button | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Bulk Channel Editor** | Edit or fix hundreds of webhook messages across one or many channels. Supports delays, limits, and custom find/replace rules. |
| **Precision Message Editor** | Target and edit a single message by link or ID with full formatting support. |
| **Webhook Management** | Add, remove, or validate stored webhooks. Tokens are **AES-256 encrypted** for safety. |
| **Advanced Operations** | Access deep message analysis, mass operations, and enterprise-grade backup & recovery tools. |
| **System Settings** | Tune performance (batch size, retries), enable/disable HTML auto-fix, set an access role, and more. |
| **Operation Monitor** | See live statistics: CPU/memory load, active jobs, uptime, and recent activity logs. |

Each section contains its own sub-buttons or modals (pop-up forms) with clear field descriptions and built-in **❓ Help** buttons.

## 📜 Key Features & Options
- **Automatic HTML Fix** – Detects and corrects entities like `&`, `<`, etc.  
- **Custom Find & Replace** – Add simple or regex rules to rewrite content on the fly.  
- **Batch Delay & Limits** – Prevents Discord rate-limits while processing large edits.
